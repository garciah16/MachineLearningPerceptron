# MachineLearningPerceptron
matlab implementation of the perceptron algorithm. includes plots.

dumped these bad boys. 

first run createTrainingSets. 
Then createWeights.
Generate hx. 

You can plot the convergence (long script, very
inefficient) and plot error rate, or just run the simulation by running
weighChange#. 

Plot the scatter plot and plane to see the plane, and plot
plane in time to see it move.
